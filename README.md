Transform source code to HTML ready for highlighting using CSS. For the moment only OCaml-related things, but it just needs the text-mate plists in `lib/syntaxes` to do other languages too. PRs welcome :) 

`tests/bin/run.t` shows the CLI in action and `tests/lib/test_md.ml` shows it in action with Markdown files. 

```sh
$ hilite --help=plain
NAME
       hilite - a command-line interface for highlighting code to HTML

COMMANDS

OPTIONS
